# Hymn-Program-v2
This Powerpoint type program is created with python, PyQt6, and  a csv full of Hymn Names. Its purpose is to put the Name of Hymns on screen so that your congregation can see what page to turn to if missed.

This program uses Python 3.12.3 installed and PyQt6

To install python 3.12.3 or the latest version of pyhton go here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

To install Pyqt6 run this command in your terminal after you install python: pip install PyQt6

I Have used pyinstaller to make it an exe file to run on different windows computers. Todo so go here: https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/installation.html

**The Main screen should look like this when opened:**
