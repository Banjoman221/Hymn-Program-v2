# Hymn-Program-v2
This Powerpoint type program is created with python, PyQt6, and  a csv full of Hymn Names. Its purpose is to put the Name of Hymns on screen so that your congregation can see what page to turn to if missed.

This program uses Python 3.12.3 installed and PyQt6

To install python 3.12.3 or the latest version of pyhton go here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

To install Pyqt6 run this command in your terminal after you install python: pip install PyQt6

I wrote a powershell script to create an exe file and copy relavant files to the created directory.
The script relies on cx_freeze to create the exe file. 
You can install it using the command: pip install --upgrade cx_Freeze
For aditional info go to https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

**The Main screen should look like this when opened:**
